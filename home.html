    <h3>An Overview</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="lead">
        When you wake up tired in the morning, wouldn't it be nice to have a freshly-brewed cup of coffee ready to go?
        One coffee maker tries to address exactly that. By pre-setting a brew time and loading the necessary ingredients
        beforehand,
        you can have this coffee maker brew your cup at the perfect time.
        While this may be nice, is the interface well-designed enough to actually use?

    <h3>The Interface</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="lead">
        Let's take a look at some sketches of the coffee maker.
      </p>
      <figure class="figure">

      <p class="lead">
        The coffee maker is able to produce coffee in two batch sizes: single-serve and carafe (multiple servings).
        It's important to note that the machine separates slots for loading in ground coffee and water for both batch
        sizes.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        For the purposes of this project, we'll also be paying particularly close attention to the display (labeled B).
      </p>
      <figure class="figure">

          alt="a sketch of the coffee maker display">
      </figure>
      <p class="lead">
        As you can see, the display has multiple buttons, a screen, and a switch. The HOUR and MINUTE
        buttons allow for adjusting the time and BREW OPTIONS allows users to select "bold" or "reg" brew. The PROGRAM
        button performs various functions necessary for toggling on the auto-brew
        feature, and it also has an indicator light to signal that the auto-brew feature is set. The switch allows users
        to choose a batch size, and the BREW NOW button starts and cancels a brew immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The problem that the interface is trying to solve is how to allow the users to quickly and intuitively preset a
        brew time and load the necessary ingredients to brew a cup of coffee.

        For my observations, I asked a few friends to preset a time to brew a carafe of coffee. To do so, the interface
        requires them

          they've successfully preset a brew time.

                    carafe), she pours it into slot D (for single-serve).
                  </li>
                  <li>She presses BREW OPTIONS multiple times and soon realizes that it does not function to set the

                  <li>She presses PROGRAM and nothing happens. She then presses and holds it, which brings up

                  <li>Having set the auto-brew time, she is unsure if it will actually brew, saying

                  <li>When the time passes and it does not brew, she presses PROGRAM to once again set the brew time.

                  <li>
                    Realizing that this must be how auto-brew is set, she readjusts the time as before, and this time
                    makes sure to press PROGRAM again to turn on indicator light.

                    As he does not hold PROGRAM while doing this, the preset time doesn't change.

                    He asks for my help again, and I direct him to hold PROGRAM while simultaneously adjusting the

                    He then presses PROGRAM again, which turns on the indicator light and confirms the preset. Later, he

                Despite having operated coffee machines before, Sophia says she struggled with this one,
                particularly when loading water for carafe brewing. She asks rhetorically, "Where the heck was I
                supposed
                to put in the water"?
                Also, while she did manage to preset the brew time, she was unsure if it was actually on or not. She
                says she did
                not see the indicator light.
                Rating the difficulty of the interface, she gives it a 4, meaning somewhat difficult. She attributes
                this to the straightforwardness
                of most of the buttons with the
                exception of PROGRAM. She also says that her actions usually produced outcomes that aligned with what
                she
                expected. The notable exception
                would be, again, the PROGRAM button, which did nothing when she pressed it the first time.

                where
                to load in the water. Like Sophia, he also poured water into the wrong
                location. He says that
                "the whole set timer thing was new to me", which would explain why he gave the interface a high
                difficulty rating
                of 5. Further, he explains that, while most of the interface worked as expected, the PROGRAM button was
                "weird". He would not have intuitively known to hold onto PROGRAM while simultaneously adjusting time if
                I had not helped him.

                only participant to pour water into the correct location for carafe brew. He attributes this to having
                played around with the machine before doing anything. He gives the interface difficulty a rating of 2,
                indicating it was fairly straightforward for him. When asked about any difficulties, like the other two
                participants,
                he says he had a bit of trouble with the PROGRAM button, adding that it's "not labeled as it should be".
                Instead, he offers
                that it should be labeled "PRESET BREW". He notes that all actions had the expected outcome, but

        so that she can excel in her schoolwork. Like many students, Susie best manages her

        One interface problem that Susie faces is that she can sometimes accidentally forget to preset
        the brew the night before. This is very inconvenient for her since she likes a tidy schedule. She also
        sometimes may pour water into the wrong place or set the wrong time, especially if she's super tired

        Susie embodies the typical user of this interface. In addition to being part of a demographic that is a major

        because
        he neglects to make sure the indicator light is on. When he goes to grab his coffee, he'll be in for a shock to
        see that his brew never started like he expected. He'll have to weigh these potential costs with
